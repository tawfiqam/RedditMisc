Of course there is the disclaimer that if there really *were* a huge imbalance of responsibility, something should be said. I'm just talking about how sometimes it's like jeez, I cooked, I did the dishes, I packed the kids' lunches, and got them ready for bed *tonight*.

We all want to believe that if you love someone, it should be completely organic and natural and shouldn't take any work, but choosing to love one another is sort of a nicer way of saying you have to work at the relationship sometimes. \n",

His idea was that you can communicate until you're blue in the face but if you aren't empathetic and caring (compassion) and generally coming from compatible perspectives it won't work out. I think definitely the idea that you'll find someone perfect for you is silly.

      "Finally: A relationship is about two people learning how to be around one another as individuals. Marriage is about being two people together as part of your community. It's not about two individuals, it's about the unit. You participate in your family, in your church (if applicable), in your friend groups, and under your government as that unit. To follow, a wedding is not strictly about a couple, it's about transitioning from being two unique people who happen to like each other into being that sociopolitical unit. Marriage will not change your relationship to each other; it won't make it more permanent, more solid, or more committed, or more happy. It does, to a certain extent, change your relationship to the world. Sometimes people confuse the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit to add: and if you're participating in the community, that community should be making an investment in your marriage, too. Your family, your congregation, your government, whatever: they should want to help you continue on as that unit of community you've started. That's why we have guests at weddings: they are making a promise to help preserve the couple, too.\n",

      "Don't think that your relationship is failing because you see so many of your friend posting the fun, romantic, happy times and the many fun things they do with their significant others on social media.  A lot of people think they are in a sad, boring relationship because it seems that everyone they know is constantly posting photos of them with their partner going on fun trips, romantic dinners, the little gifts they get each other, etc.  But think about it.  Would they post a video of them in a big argument?  Would they share all of the times they annoyed each other?  Would they post a picture of themselves crying because one hurt the other's feelings?  No.  Social media is not a reliable source to see what a relationship should be like.  All healthy relationships will have very difficult times and situations.  There will be many arguments, fights, and tears.  It doesn't mean that you've failed.  It means that you're getting to know each other more and you aren't afraid to be yourself in front of the person you love.\n",

So sometimes we may have to go to bed without having discussed the issue. We may still be a little bit angry.

Don't confide in other people when it's your spouse you should be confiding in. Not meaning in circumstances like abuse or anything like that. But looking at it as your wife/husband is the only member of your family that you choose. You don't choose your parents, siblings, children, ect. That in itself should command a level of love and respect that is a level above any other relationship you have in life because it is a unique relationship you won't have with anyone else. \n",

A little more in depth, setting aside jealousy requires both to be faithful, let each other know you're faithful, and don't put yourselves in ANY position to be unfaithful completely ruling out jealousy. Secondly, each having their 'own thing'. It's all fine and well to have shared friends, hobbies, and interests, but each needs friends, hobbies, and interests of their own. In other words, don't try to share everything together. It's worked for us, hope it's helpful.\n",

      "When looking for a partner, treat the quest for the person as such. You are looking for a partner in life. Lust does not last, and love is powerfully persuasive and can cause you to settle with someone that may not be perfectly compatible to you and your views of the world. I am a man and when I think about my girlfriend, I think of her as a guy. I ask myself, \"Would I want this guy to be with me always for the rest of my life? How does he view the world? What is most important to him, how does he treat people, will he be a good life partner for me?\" Once all the sex and boobs are gone, it really helps illustrate the compatibility of the person.\n",

      "“Loving someone is like moving into a house,\" Sonja used to say. \"At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”\n",

      "I was engaged and didn't feel like I was making the right choice. Everything was ok enough, but I just felt like I wanted more than my fiance wanted out of life. I was so young, now that I think about it. I was maybe 22. Anyway, I was a manager at a 24-hour restaurant and we had a police officer who always took the detail on Fridays and Saturdays. He was older and had all sons, seven of them. Anyway, I got him a meal on his break and pretty spontaneously asked him how he knew he was marrying the right person when he picked his wife. He looked at me funny because we were not really besties or anything, but then he took my question seriously. He said that before he dated her, he was with another girl and he was absolutely crazy about her, and he asked his father the same question. His father told him, it's great to be in love and crazy about a girl, but marriage is about family and you have to marry the person you want to be the mother of your children. So he broke it off with the girl because she was not at all the person he wanted to have a family with. He said, if you're going to have children, you have to think about that before anything else because you will absolutely regret it if you don't. He was so right. I eventually broke it off with the guy I was with and I never have regretted it for a minute. I love my husband and we've been through a lot. There is no way I could have ever raised kids with the guy I was with back then. I will forever be thankful for that advice. \n",

      "I don't know shit about love or relationships, with such little experience, but from that experience, I know that trust on either side of the relationship *never* comes back, if it's broken, and no matter how it's broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience:\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to have a buggy Chrome, which wouldn't record my browser history. I don't know why or how. It worked normally when I got it, but somewhere down the line, it just stopped recording it, and since it didn't affect my browsing experience, I never bothered reinstalling it in order to fix it. A few years later, in the middle of a relationship, one day, I come back to my laptop from the bathroom, sit down and go back to what I was doing. Not ten seconds later, I get asked \"Why did you delete your browser history?\" Red flag no.1. She attempted to go through my browser history, behind my back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I explained the problem, and even went into one of my bookmarks and then back to the browser history to show that it wasn't recording it at all. I was immediately accused of finding a way to disable it at an earlier date. Red flag no.2. She assumes that I had something to hide, and went to lengths to hide it before she even thought to look for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I denied everything she threw at me, with logical responses wherever I could, which would disprove her accusations, but it never stopped. By the end of the night, both of our voices were hoarse, all reason was lost, and we were both ready to kill each other. The only thing that stopped us from fighting was fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "730 nights of fighting until we drop later, that relationship ended. Every day I'd hoped that it would all change. That she would realize I wasn't hiding anything, and that I wasn't lying to her face. Why else would she stick around so long, if *I* was the one hiding things from her? Alas, every night, she found something to take out of context so that she could accuse me of doing Bad Thing No.8397462™. Even long after I reinstalled Chrome and got my browser history fixed, it didn't matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I knew she kept checking my laptop while I was out of the room. I'd always take note of where my cursor was before I left, and it'd always be somewhere else when I came back. Her lack of trust in me caused me to lack trust in her, so, before long, it had just gotten worse between us. Not to mention all the shit you hear about \"If they accuse you of X, but you know you would never do X, they are probably doing X\" was sending my own paranoia through the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I lack solid evidence, many cues throughout our relationship, and the amount of time it took her to \"move on\" after she was \"completely destroyed\" by us breaking up makes me firmly believe that she had been cheating on me. But, assuming that it wasn't the case, to this day, I have no idea what I said or did that made her ever think I would be hiding something from her, or if it was just paranoia on her part. The trust never comes back, even if you *never* gave them a reason to not trust you. Don't fool yourself into thinking a breach in trust can just go away over time, like a scab or bruise, and one day find yourself four years into a relationship that has been nothing but hell for you for two years. Even if you were the one whose trust was breached, just end it. Save yourselves the trouble, the hell, and the heartbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing up, I'd always heard that trust is what a relationship is built on. That the whole thing can't thrive without it, and that, once the foundation is removed, the structure has already fallen, and it's too late, and futile to even attempt to put it back. Throughout my relationship, I didn't want to believe that. Who would have thought that one of the most common pieces of relationship advice is good advice? Love blinded me, and it lead to two years of hell. Don't let that become you. I'm just lucky it ended after two years, and not the rest of my life, which it very well could have, under certain, very slightly different circumstances.\n",

      "When we were shopping for our house we looked at houses from one end of the scale to the other.  We were young, successful professionals that had been \"approved\" for a pretty high home loan amount for our area and could have bought a much larger, more expensive home than we ended up buying. My aunt suggested that we buy what we needed (which was still a new, 3 bedroom home) rather than the most expensive home available. We planned on foregoing parenthood so we didn't need a giant house for two people.  And it would give us extra money to invest and travel without a potential financial burden. Our realtor was almost angry that we weren't buying at the top end of our pre-approved  home loan scale and our friends were unimpressed since they were buying much larger homes.  Then the housing market bubble burst, the economy began to struggle, people started getting laid off, and friends started losing homes and getting divorced. We endured well enough through that nonsense but then my wife fell seriously ill, and ended up unable to work.  As tough as life has been, we've never had to argue or deal with the tension of struggling to make the mortgage payment. We've had to adjust our lives to fit our new financial situation but cutting out several vacations and shopping sprees per year is much easier than selling a home and downsizing in a crap housing market while one of us is sick and homebound.  I have no doubt that living at or even slightly below our means has made our relationship easier to endure the other challenges of life.  Be smart financially and avoid having that strain if you can help it.  Life is difficult enough without having to watch every penny that comes and goes. And FWIW we also signed prenups.  That way if we do have a big fight over something, neither of us starts thinking about taking the house or savings from the other as payback. Not that we have much to take, but making smart decisions during the good times is better than making any decisions during the tough times.  Not the most romantic advice but marriage is a business partnership as much as a romantic relationship.\n",

      "At a basic level, you should take the time to truly differentiate the difference between love and lust. That sexual desire for others does not have to take away from a strong, loving relationship. A person can observe and appreciate another person without it negatively affecting their feelings for their spouse. I also believe expecting someone to be sexually exclusive the rest of their life is unrealistic and not conducive to a sexually healthy relationship, but that's my personal soap box.\n",
      "My husband and I are in an open relationship. We have sex with other people, often independent of the other. It was an evolved lifestyle that started with me deciding that him sleeping with someone else would not be a deal breaker for me. It was a long process of growing as partners and understanding our and each others sexual desires that could encompass multiple pages of text, but long story short, we managed to separate love from lust and realized that he could be balls deep inside someone and still want to come home and spend the rest of his life with his amazing wife (because him wanting to fuck someone else did not make me any less amazing to him). Then once we started actually experimenting with others and were able to apply logic to real life, we discovered that having sex with other people was pretty awesome. It allowed us to experience that \"new and exciting\" feeling, while appreciating the comfortable loving sex we had together. It allowed us to shift our sexual preferences that each other were unable to accommodate  (I love having sex with girls) or just not that into (his preference for anal and blow jobs, of which I'm less than enthusiastic) onto to other willing and able sexual partners. One of my favorite memories was a night I was tired and worn out from work and trying to make dinner and my husband was being persistently frisky. Thankfully, a close sex friend was over and I not-so-subtly asked her to take care of him so I could finish dinner and have some alone time. All of us ended up having a good night as a result. \n",
      "I fully advocate that different couples have different needs and should not do things that make them uncomfortable. However, I feel like this particular issue is deeply rooted in the social misconception that love=sex. Society has dictated to us that if your spouse truly loves you, they wouldn't possibly ever want to have a sexual encounter with anyone other than you. And I feel that this sets couples up to fail who have otherwise strong relationships.\n",
      "And I don't mean that couples have to have sex outside of their relationship to prosper, but taking the time to release that stigma that it's inherently bad can make a big difference in how you handle sex related issues down the road. It's not automatic or easy, but definitely a thought process that can be altered if you take the time to work on it. \n",

      "I've been with my s/o for a year and a half this coming Tuesday, and when we first had our disputes on whatever - usually a miscommunication, we sometimes just spoke irrationally and even mentioned it to each other when we really got to the core of the subject. Anybody could understand the bit of advice, but it's following through that really makes the difference. To be honest (since my name isn't on here I'm more comfortable with stating such) a majority of our problems we faced together we're based on miscommunication, only 1 or 2 instances out of let's say 10 notable times were actually things we both realized we needed to discuss. I used to be a person before I met my s/o who could fly off the handle if my emotions got the better of me and I said *whatever* to support my pride. We even made an additional rule I would like to strongly mention, **never have important things discussed through text messages** ! I'm more of a person to call her up and ask her what we need to talk about, and the new rule based on the second piece mentioned is that whenever one of us feels we need to either talk on the phone or put a pin in it until later to talk face-to-face, then we let it simmer for the meantime. Communication is always key, regardless of the language or method being used.\n",

I didnt really understand it at first but after 10 years of marriage I understand that in marriage there will be alot of ups and down and sometimes it will be more than what you can bare alone. In that moment you will realize that unconditional love will be what holding your marriage together. A friend of mine had an accident and had a huge scar on her face and very disturbing one at that. The moment she was bed ridden the husband pack his bag and left her. Sad real life experience for me...\n",

Back when my wife and I were still dating in college (been dating about 2 1/2 years by then), we were walking back from dinner to our dorm building when seemingly out of the blue she just started crying.

There was desire in me to force her to keep asking away from everyone else to not embarrass myself or her while she was crying, but I decided that she just needed to stop, sit down on the curb, and just cry. I wanted to ask why, to help solve the problem, and to fix it, because that's what I'm wired to do as an engineer. But her needs were more important than mine at the time, so all I did was let her sit down right on the curb, in front of everyone else, and just cry. For 6 minutes all I did was hold her and let her do the rest. We still look back to that day and we both agree that I did the right thing. Sometimes you just need to stop whatever you're doing and meet your partner's immediate needs, and nothing else. Simply being there with your full attention is often enough. When they are ready for help, they will ask.\n",

      "Most of my patients aren't even cognizant enough to tell me if I'm being a dick or not. But if you hold their hand and hum to them, instead of talking or trying to \"make it okay,\" they settle right into whatever their environment is. Deep down, people don't want to hear rationalizations of their problems. They don't want advice. They don't want to know that it'll be okay. They want to know that someone is there with them, holding their hand and saying \"you are loved for who you are, right now.\" I've watched patients go from screaming \"SOMEONE HELP ME RIGHT NOW\" down the halls, over and over again, to quietly nuzzling up to me just because I held their hand and told them I would make sure they were safe. It's not just a dementia thing. We all want to feel protected and loved. Fixing problems is a long term solution. Sometimes, we just want to be able to settle into a soft embrace and feel supported.\n",

The first three questions are always: are you hungry? Tired? Cold? You have no idea how often I get hangry and surprise myself. Sometimes it's \"oh yeah, let's grab something to eat, I'll feel better\". Sometimes it's a deeper issue: did something happen at work, talked to someone that upset you, stressed out about something?

When you love someone and you have a disagreement with them, you don't (or shouldn't) want to be right and prove them wrong. Even if you know you are right, you *want* them to be right because you love them and you don't want to see them get shut down. You do everything you can to see things from their point of view, to find a point of view from which their opinion is valid.\n",

I was having a 48 hour VEEG (I have epilepsy) done - for those who don't know, basically lots of electrodes hooked to your head and your brain waves are monitored for a set amount of time. Back to story, I'm in the hospital for the test. My fiance (now husband) comes in to visit and shortly after a nurse runs in asking if I just had a seizure. According to her, my brain waves had started going crazy (jumping up and down) about time the fiance showed up. We still joke that he got to know what happens in my head when I see him.\n",

I am one of those people who gets grumpy and difficult when tired and having a spouse who would try to keep me awake to discuss things always just pissed me off which made me say things I didn't mean.

Can we plan on going to bed and picking up this conversation at 7 pm tomorrow?\".

I have known of people to interpret the idea that \"love is a decision\" to mean that feelings have nothing to do with the matter: that you could pick a random person off the street and just decide to love them. Of course this is not true. Compatibility is critical. Love must be based on something real, or it is not love. So yes there are times you love and stay with your partner because you've made the choice to do so, and times when you may force yourself to act in loving ways even though you don't feel like it. But underneath it all there must be a foundation or even the idea of love is meaningless.\n",

My mom and my grandmother were nowhere near the same at any age, and if my stepdad had looked at my grandmother and thought that would be what Mom would become, he would've run the other way because he and my grandmother hated each other. (Mostly because he would NOT take her shit, especially towards me.

My SO and I have found that for us its better to talk when we are calmer and have had time to think about what we're actually mad about. Now, this only works if you are able to talk about things honestly and fully the next day. It doesn't work if you just bury things deep down to explode later. But if we can wake up and say, \"when you did/say X, it made me feel Y, and I think it's because of Z. This is what I need...\" whereas the night before it would have been something closer to \"you're a selfish asshole... blah blah\" which would be untrue and totally unproductive and only cause everyone pain. \n",

These may be critical issues, and ones we might *want* to solve, but are unaware of the to even begin fixing. We may have the tools to solve for the things we know, and methods of obtaining the tools for things we know we can't solve immediately.

You go over your code line by line and explain to the object describing what your code is *supposed* to do, and often, you'll discover what went wrong. The way it works is that by going over the *whole* problem, step by step, in the most basic way *as though you try to explain to another person*, you are giving yourself a different way to think about the problem.\n",

It's nobody's fault that these tools aren't common knowledge, and you shouldn't fault them for not knowing. So while it may be frustrating, as somebody who *can* find ways to solve their problems, it might help to be a little sympathetic to those who lack those tools, as you may not know whether it's their fault or not.\n",

She and I have very different interests and tastes (especially in shows/movies), but I've always made a point to find some that we may be able to enjoy together. Not only is it near impossible to get her to go to these movies with me sometimes, I can barely get her to feign interest in a trailer that I bookmarked earlier in the day (just to show her) - barely looking up from her phone or iPad most of the time. We've talked about this multiple times (and other contributing factors). I'm always hit with the guilt I mean too much to her and that it can change, but it reverts back to the way it was soon after, and I have trouble facing what kind of impact it would bring on my life to actually end things.

The worst thing is my husband says he loves me and now that I'm finally done with all of it he tries to do these things.. it makes me feel even worse because that means that he didn't want to do these small things on his own. I always had to make him do stuff and I'm so sick of it.. I love him but it's not enough. He starved me from lack of attention and love and just conversation. I feel like I've tried everything. My family is so not understanding because I always lie and say everything is fine even though it's far from fine. I have tried to make him go to sleep with me one evening per week.. but that was to much to ask.. I've asked him to talk to me for 20 minutes a day just about how your day went or anything.. that was too much to ask. I feel so bad and selfish but I can't live like this anymore. It drains me like nothing else. I can't stand him anymore. If I don't leave him I feel like I don't want to live anymore.

One of the commenters said that when there's something that needs to get done, like the toilet paper roll needs to get changed, or the trash needs to get taken out, she does it immediately, rather than leaving it for someone else. Because \"someone else\" is likely to be someone she loves, and why would she leave them extra work to do? This really struck a chord with me because one of the commonly touted lessons of adulthood is that nobody else is going to clean up after you. If you live by yourself, that's true, but if you don't, it's selfish to put another person in the position of either cleaning up after you or having to ignore your mess. \n",

See she's kind of one of those girls who guys try to get with because they think it will be easy due to her looks. So she had some terrible boyfriends who made her feel like shit everyday, hence the depression. She actually looked me in the eyes when we talked, other people she would glance in different directions. Then she started doing this little smirk when saw me, which turned into smiles. Now  almost two years later she feels like herself again and feels love doing, and worth something. She was finally able to trust again. She is finally the vibrant young woman she was meant to be.  But it all started with her just looking up with those big hazel eyes and maintaining eye contact for even a few seconds.   \n",

Not all women like flowers but every woman has her own version. Also greeting her with kisses as often as possible is a good idea.

Love is caring for and looking out for someone even when you're not happy with them.  It's deciding that no matter what, that's your person and you're sticking with them.  It's like my wife once said, arguing after we got married was different because she felt secure in the fact that no matter how we left things, I'd be there in the morning, so she felt less anxious (which consequently makes the argument less combustible).\n",

      "A big part of this for me is considering the actions you take when you love someone, and choosing to do those things for your partner. When you're in the midst of a \"butterflies in your stomach\" burst of crazy feelings-love, loving gestures are easy and natural; you buy the person little gifts that made you think of them (because everything makes you think of them!) You write them love letters, because you *want* to make them happy and show how much you care. All the cheesy bullshit that comes naturally when you're in love. But sometimes you don't have those feelings, and instead you have to deliberately choose to act in a loving manner. The feelings will eventually come back, but in the meantime, you have to maintain the relationship. \n",

      "I've been with my partner 8 years, and there are occasions where I feel totally disconnected from him and times where we're on top of the world and everything feels perfect. When things aren't so good, though, I've learned to try more consciously to act out my decision-love. I buy him beer I know he'll like and put it in the fridge, or I make sure his laundry makes it to the dryer when he falls asleep. I make food he likes after he's had a hard day, or I scratch his back even when I'm fucking tired and just wanna go to sleep. I do those things when I'm head over heels in love with him too, but it's easy then. To me, that's what the real *work* of long-term commitment is- choosing to act in a loving manner at each junction, even in the absence of intrinsic motivation to do so. \n",

      "The problem arises when two people in a relationship have drastically different standards on when things should get done. Laundry doesn't have to be an issue so long as separate hampers are kept, but if standards are misaligned for something like kitchen cleanliness then it can add strain to the relationship. Being flexible upwards AND downwards with your standards is an important part of a working relationship. If you insist that a partner matches your high/low standards then you aren't compromising, you are dictating. A lot of people might think the one with higher standards should be the one to set the bar, but that's simply not fair to the other person. There are a lot of good reasons to leave things dirty for longer just as there might be for keeping them cleaner. For example it can be more efficient to do one large load of dishes than multiple small ones. Or schedules might make it difficult for one person to do chores with the same frequency as another.\n",

      "Yeah that sentiment about not going to bed angry never made sense to me....until I went to bed fuming at my mom. I knew it was more likely aimed towards marriage and I've met many people who see it as more or less of a philosophy than anything. I agree with the philosophy myself. But my God, it's not just a philosophy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The morning after arguing with my mom, and going to sleep angry (because I was \"too angry for (my) usual philosophical perspective\" and \"too tired to care\" - we've all been there)....I woke up wishing I resolved it. I never usually went to bed angry before (like I said, I'm an odd, over-thinking and philosophical type - an Aspie at that), but the morning after, I realized there's actually a psychological effect. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was angrier, and it felt more \"deep seated\"(?) in a way. Like, more unresolvable. That incident of course, made me draw my own conclusions - that, during sleep, the brain pretty much uses your sub-/un-conscious mind to deal with stress - hence, \"dreaming\". After you go to sleep, any emotions have already been poured into your subconscious mind, and are no longer a task for your conscious mind (at least not as much, if at all) to deal with. After all, your conscious mind is going to need room for the next day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, if you don't resolve arguments before bed - or \"go to bed angry\" - the emotions are deeper seated and it gives way for resentment to grow. The issue becomes harder to resolve, the emotion does too. \n",
      "\n",
      "It can also give way for unpleasant dreams, a restless, irritable nights sleep - and so on. Everything is more complicated when you don't go to bed in the right state of mind (if you somehow manage to rest). It's also not beneficial for your physical health to have deep rooted emotional stress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, am I saying it's gonna tear you apart if you go to bed angry once? Of course not - just know there's a better chance of resolving things for a better nights sleep and lower chance of resentment in the long run if you resolve issues before bed. Also, it's nice to wake up feeling bright and rested. But yeah that's my take - I haven't done much research but I like to think and problem solve. \n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR** - \"going to bed angry\" is more than just philosophical, and effects many aspects of health (as most may already know) and ability to resolve conflicts/any possible resentment. Sorry for going on a tangent too.\n",

And fighting is healthier than keeping it all pent up inside. Best to confront what youre unhappy about and not let wounds fester, and have that confirmation from your partner early on that theyre willing to change for you if something really bothers you (and of course vice versa). My partner and I are both have mental health issues so at times we both get overly sensitive about things because of past experiences or what not but discussing our issues helps to minimize that for sure. There's no way you can spend so much time with a person and never have a single issue with them.

After 8 months I noticed a few things: I was miserable because there wasn't much physical affection, I felt like I was putting out too much effort with little to none in return, and I kept wondering if she was even wanting to be in the relationship. After 8 months I was emotionally exhausted, lovesick, homesick, and the advice of my parents, grandparents, and friends was the same: it needed to end. So we talked, turns out she wasn't feeling it, and I cut things off. It sucked so hard because I was still in love. But it's been a week, and I feel pretty good about things now. Every now and then I get a bit of a hangup, but the pros outweigh the cons.

For those who are serious about having a loving and lasting marriage, these principles must be discovered and expressed, whether one even knows of the existence of Marriage Encounter or not.  Love is a decision, not a tsunami of feelings that carry you away.  There is a tsunami of feelings that carry people away, and people call it love, but it is an illusion of real love.  Real love is the decision to sacrifice for the other person over and over and over.  For those who do not discover and express these principles, the relationship becomes drama and divorce.\n",

But I just don't get how you can be a human being without trying to do the rubber duck thingie when thinking about how/why someone does something or are the way they are. Do you just go by your initial gut feeling ? Oh that thing he said hurt me so he probably meant to do that, or he continues doing it on purpose just to annoy/hurt me. Not giving people the benefit of the doubt or trying to understand where they are coming from and assuming the worst seem like a recipe for disaster. I guess not needing another pair of eyes for your relationship is IMPORTANT to me. It leads me to believe that you don't fucking care enough, you don't think things through, you don't have your own mind and thoughts and/or maybe you are not smart enough. This makes you unattractive to me in more than one aspects, so do I really want to procreate with you ?

Changing it would make me not be me and I want to be me, maybe talking with me would make me consider making a slow gradual change to my character if I feel that would be more beneficial to me. The people I'm criticizing are the ones that need the opinions or viewpoints of others to make important decisions or realizations about their own life. There is nothing wrong in that happening rarely, but if you are abusing this, you are a slave to social norms and I do not like you. Feel free to not like me all you want, see if I care.

Instead of going out in the evening and having wine with our meal, we'll drive so we can go somewhere different which would have cost too much in a taxi. And we'll go out earlier and to places where it's acceptable to take children. Tomorrow we're going to a tapas place at 1pm then shopping (her choice) then in the evening we'll make a curry and catch up on Homeland. But it is difficult with a baby, we struggle to time her feeds and sleeps and consequently our nice day plans are \"subject to change.\"\n",

So in these disagreements, they'd take advantage of my attitude and use it as a time to make personal attacks, banking on my patience to allow them to do so. Yet I never felt secure to bring forth my grievances because they were always met with remarks along the lines of, \"Well then I guess we should just break up!\" So I was patient but the two girls I've had long term relationships with so far (21 years old) weren't.

I haven't gone through a full cycle yet (my cycles are typically ~40 days), but I can already tell it's a huge game changer for me. After 19 years of crazy periods and even crazier PMS, I'm incredibly grateful to my doctor for diagnosing me and making me aware of PMDD. It's put a lot of past depression in my life into perspective and also helped me be more accepting of who I am.

      "This is a conversation I had to have with my husband when 'my money' (i.e. Any money left over in my personal account after the standing order went out to the joint account) was getting tight, but I was still going to the waxing lady every 4  weeks and parted with £115 each time. That's a lot in my books--and my husband's, too. I asked him how much he thought it cost to keep this level of grooming up each month, and he genuinely believed it was something like £50. When I told him the actual amount, and explained that I would be perfectly content without, even if it's just for a few months, he was more than happy to go halves with me on the cost. It's a joint expense, even if it's just on my body. \n",

It can just be a discussion, it doesn't have to be made into a screaming match (which, like I said is something you want to be aware of early on in the relationship so you aren't blindsided by the fact that your partner can't deal with issues like an adult.)\n",

But asking your partner to do a better job helping with the housework or stop doing something you find hurtful is an acceptable type of change to ask for. In most cases it's not like you're demanding your partner to change just stating that something makes you feel a certain way, and any good partner would do something to make sure you feel good (as long as whats being asked of them is reasonable of course).\n",

In my experience, everyone I've known who got married before age 23 runs struggles with arrested development in that they accidentally stopped growing as an individual and focused on being a couple instead. There's some development and self-discovery yet to happen in your twenties and being attached to someone makes it a little more difficult to fully go through that. Not impossible, but difficult.\n",

Just worry about letting them become anything other than they truly are, the desire for novelty. We always want something new, but a happy marriage makes it pretty easy to just let those crushes go.

There have been times when I've thought about what life would have been like if I'd dated/slept around before we got together, but I never feel a sense of regret. Having heard from my friends, I haven't missed out on anything by avoiding having a string of shitty encounters instead of being with someone who is perfect for me (note that I did NOT say that he himself was perfect). I remember the butterflies and electricity you feel with a new relationship, where every comment is loaded and there's that buzz you feel every time you think about them, and thus far I've never regretted being in the phase I am now, where there's still attraction and passion, but also comfort and the support you get from someone you've known and been with for years.

This relationship is the only one I've known for my whole adult life, and I don't feel like I'm missing anything because he and I have grown through it together, and continue to do so. I think so long as you can keep your sense of self and stay true to that, and respect her while she does the same, you'll be able to go fairly far. And, if the time comes when you know the relationship is no longer working for you because you've changed as people, maybe it'll be time to split up.

      "Hi there, \n",
      "\n",
      "I just turned 27 and I'm engaged. By the time we're married, we'll have been together 3.5 years. I had this same question when I was younger. I'm not qualified to give advice, but I have lived what you're asking about. Also, obligatory: first post.\n",
      "\n",
      "First piece of advice: don't get engaged unless you've been dating 2 years. I had gotten bored of everyone (before I started dating my now-fiance) at about the 1.5 yr-or-less point. You can cycle through any pattern of (normal, non-abusive) behavior in a relationship in about 18 months. Got a problem with your partner that they promised to fix? You can see if they reverted back to type. Feeling randomly dissatisfied again with your relationship again? What has changed (or not) since the last time you felt this way? You can also weather huge life events, like we did, and see if it changes your relationship. Loss of a job, cancer scare, hellish job and hellish commute, a big promotion, financially dependent family members, and more! \n",
      "\n",
      "You can certainly talk about the possibility of getting married, what type of married relationship you want, and what matters to you before that 2-year point. But give yourself enough time to \"get bored\" and see how you respond in that state of \"boredom.\" Aziz Ansari does a funny bit about this where he compares marriage to sweaters--after 2 years of wearing his favorite sweater, it's totally possible he realizes one day it's hideous and throws it out. Why would you get married in less time than it takes you to evaluate a sweater? (Joking, of course, but this rang true for me.) It's not foolproof: I know a couple who broke up after 5 years never having had a serious conversation about their future, or even any serious disagreements. That is how I found out that \"the puppy love stage\" can last for a really long time, so just \"giving the relationship some time\" isn't the right approach. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second piece of advice: Live in each moment of your relationship, and don't worry too much about getting bored someday. If you are really living in each moment of your relationship, engaging with that person, listening to them (even if they want to share a story you've heard three times already), and reciprocating when they do these things, and you're happy when you are \"all in\" even as you figure out what's for dinner, then you probably won't get bored \"someday\" because you find something engaging in the everyday minutiae. There may be times I'm bored, but I'm not bored with my partner. It's not my partner who's boring me, and I've paid enough attention to them that I can say that with confidence. You won't always feel butterflies, and things may not always feel so \"easy\", but if after 2 years you are still truly engaged and interacting with your partner and it makes you happy, it's a good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third piece of advice: Know that your feelings will change, and the rate at which you love will change. I mentioned that I don't always feel butterflies, and this at first really troubled me. I felt \"drunk in love\" and \"butterflies\" for so much longer with my partner than I had ever before. When that love changed, I got really nervous. Analyzing my own feelings, my psyche,  myself, and my partner for weeks on end in my head: was it a sign? Did something change? Maybe I don't see marriage in our future now?  Does love just \"plateau\" eventually? Is this just part of love--boredom? Maybe 2 months passed with me asking these questions, not really feeling \"butterflies\" and not \"falling deeper in love\", when suddenly, in the middle of a conversation where I wasn't secretly psychoanalyzing myself, my love grew deeper in a way I didn't even know was possible.  It turned out that I had just experienced a step-function of sorts, where my love for my partner deepened suddenly and hugely after what I thought was a plateau.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Previously with my fiance, love seemed like constant, quick acceleration in a way that was new and exciting for me--there were no speedbumps or u-turns. I thought \"here's a love that can last a lifetime because it can keep growing.\" When that changed, I didn't know what it meant. In that 2 month period where I thought my love had \"plateau-ed\", I really thought about ending things, because I crave constant growth and personal improvement. What I learned is that your love, like a child, will grow at different rates throughout your life. You need to date people long enough to experience these emotional changes together before committing in marriage to them, and also give yourself opportunities to keep falling in love with them. I had never experienced this with anyone other than my fiance, because there were other issues in these relationships or they weren't right for me, so I had never been to this emotional place. After I experienced the step-function, I thought about what an idiot I would have been to end things after that 2 month plateau. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I experienced something similar about 6 months into our engagement, I was able to 1) focus on the real problem, and 2) be patient. About one or two months later once I had time to process things (& so did my partner) we had an amazing conversation about how we were feeling, the wedding planning, our lives, etc. and I fell even more in love with my partner than before. You guessed it: step-function! This is the new rate of love in our relationship, and it I've given myself lots of time to see if I like it. *Winks* I do.\n",

When we got gifted money or earned it from side jobs, we each put it in our own account.  It's taken some of the stress of when one of us finds something relatively expensive that we want but not really in the budget from the main account, or (in my case) something the other person just wouldn't care about.  That way we each can pursue our hobbies without worrying that we're depriving the other or that we'll be tight for the month.\n",

      "So the beginning of the relationship, when you first fall in love with someone, is drenched with oxytocin, which is the love/bonding hormone. Most research suggests that that initial burning crazy phase lasts a couple of years at most before you sort of settle into a more routine, steady kind of love. Everyone experiences this- many people call it the \"honeymoon period.\" Optimally, you should like and love your partner and find her attractive even when that initial burst of hormones has faded. \n",

We've even discussed the possibility of opening our relationship, so I know that if I really wanted to act on those feelings, there's a framework for me to do that. But at the end of the day, I prefer my SO for a million different reasons, some of which are deep and abiding, some of which are convenience, and some of which are totally arbitrary.  \n",

If you disagree on something maybe you can try something inbetween that is the best solution, maybe you try her method, then yours. But does it affect your love for that person ? If so, why ? If not, you have probably achieved true love and you are happy person and can be one without your SO or multiple SOs. Let's stop talking about what the current reality is, I don't think most people like it. Stop accepting it as a given, challenge it, rip it apart, build it anew, if it looked like a monkey, why not reshape it into an alien. And yes, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, we try to simplify everything, there is a good reason for that, simple things are perfect. A dot is one of the simplest mathematical abstractions, one could say it's perfect. If we are not trying to get to perfect, I think I'm in the wrong universe...If you think mathematics and physics and science don't have a role to play in human emotions and relationships I think I won't be able to argue with you, but do you really really like the way things are right now ? Are you leaving it for the next generation to fight it out ? Fuck relationships, they are not supposed to be perfect, they are supposed to try and approach perfection over time, never reaching it, always getting better. If it breaks along the way, it's not a good relationship, both parties should be better off.\n",

Things like how much should go into the shared account from each person? If there's a discrepancy in earnings this is something nice to have worked out and codified. What should be done in the event of disability or incapacitation? Do you have heirlooms and other assets to declare prior to joining that you want to go somewhere specific in the event of death or divorce? Things like this are super important to talk about BEFORE the marriage and, while it may seem 'unromantic' or be an uncomfortable topic to broach, it will serve you immeasurably to have these things talked about and a plan worked out prior to it becoming a necessity.\n",

It\\'s perfectly fine, and even healthy, to have a hobby or something that is your own. As long as your hobby isn\\'t to get away from your SO, then you should have no problems. (ie: I love fishing, and my wife hates it. She is always welcome to join me, but I\\'m going fishing regardless).\\n\\n* Some things are worth standing your ground on, and some things it\\'s better to concede. You\\'ve heard \"pick your battles\", and it\\'s been an ongoing saying for a reason. Finances... definitely worth standing your ground. How the other person puts up dishes or hangs clothes, unless it\\'s damaging things... get over it.\\n\\n* It\\'s never OK to belittle the other party. You are equals in the relationship and it\\'s imperative that you view each other as such. (ie: My wife was unemployed for a while [by choice due to crappy job market in the area], but she took care of other things while I was the primary bread winner. Now that she is working again, we both share the household chores because we are on equal ground in the relationship... always.)\\n\\n* If your SO randomly blows up at you over something seemingly benign, it\\'s almost never about that immediate event. There\\'s a fair chance that something else has been eating at or just generally stressing them out and this little event just set them off. It may be best to remove yourself for about 10-20 minutes and let them cool down, then you can come together and talk it over and address the real problem.\\n\\n* If you find yourself becoming jealous, there is likely one of the issues at play... \\n\\n               1. You have issues trusting your SO and that needs to be talked about between both of you.\\n\\n               2. You are (possibly subconsciously) afraid you don\\'t treat them well enough and are afraid that are seeking to have that void filled by someone else. If you are treating them as well as you possibly can, but still feel this way, then it\\'s something you need to seriously talk about with your SO (seeing a theme here?).\\n\\n               3.  It could be that a lack of communication between you means that you aren\\'t reassured about your SO\\'s feelings for you and their commitment to you. Again... talk about it.\\n\\n* Try new things together. Each of you pick something that both of you will try together. You may find that both of you enjoy it, or just one of you enjoys it (and now you have a new hobby for the first bullet point). Do this when things start to get stale and/or complacent.\\n\\n* You may always love your SO, but you may not be totally into them all the time. Your relationship will go through phases where you are REALLY into each other, followed by cooling phases that border on indifference to each other (kinda like having a roommate). Don\\'t panic when things cool off because it\\'s going to happen with someone that you are with for (hopefully) decades. It doesn\\'t mean your relationship is ending, it\\'s just one of the phases. Just don\\'t let the cool phases last indefinitely.  \\n\\n* As others have said before, love is a verb. SHOW your SO you love them by doing things for them, telling them often that you love them, showing a genuine interest in their day/week, trying something that your SO enjoys (thrift-shopping, hiking, video games, etc.) and make sure they know that you are wanting to try it out because it\\'s something they enjoy and you want to see if they enjoy it to.\\n\\n* Talk out your problems. Failure to adequately communicate will almost guarantee failure.'}\n",

Even as a one-night-stand, someone who respects you as a human will help you protect your future, and if they don't respect you enough to do that, they aren't worth your time.\\n\\nFinally: A relationship is about two people learning how to be around one another as individuals. Marriage is about being two people together as part of your community. It's not about two individuals, it's about the unit. You participate in your family, in your church (if applicable), in your friend groups, and under your government as that unit. To follow, a wedding is not strictly about a couple, it's about transitioning from being two unique people who happen to like each other into being that sociopolitical unit. Marriage will not change your relationship to each other; it won't make it more permanent, more solid, or more committed, or more happy. It does, to a certain extent, change your relationship to the world. Sometimes people confuse the two.\\n\\nEdit to add: and if you're participating in the community, that community should be making an investment in your marriage, too. Your family, your congregation, your government, whatever: they should want to help you continue on as that unit of community you've started. That's why we have guests at weddings: they are making a promise to help preserve the couple, too.\"}\n",

Marry the person who brings out your best and will stand beside you at your worst.\\n\\nLife will happen. You\\'ll screw up. You\\'ll fight. You\\'ll probably even slam a few doors and say something horrible you don\\'t really mean.\\n\\nThat\\'s what happens when we\\'re human. We\\'re flawed. Expecting perfection,rainbows, and glitter is unrealistic.\\n\\nWhenever a couple tells me, \"We never fight,\" I know they\\'re in or already having trouble.\\n\\nNo one can look great, have a perfect home, perfect kids, job, friends and be happy all the time. Believe me, I\\'ve tried.\\n\\nYou\\'re going to lose a job, have money problems, have a death in the family, bury a pet, lose your hair, get wrinkles, have diarrhea, vomit, forget deodorant, put your foot in your mouth, leave the seat up\\xa0 and spill stuff on the sofa.\\n\\n\\nThe wedding is one day, the marriage for the rest of your lives.\\n\\nI\\'m planning a wedding right now. I actually found my wedding gown today. It\\'s a very exciting time and a lot of attention goes into things like dresses, bridesmaids, invitations, parties, flowers, food, music, venue, etc.\\n\\nThe day you marry you look the best you\\'ll ever look. It\\'s taken hours of preparation and planning to look as good as we do on our wedding day, and it\\'s all down hill from there.\\n\\nIt\\'s very exciting, but it\\'s not your life. Life is farting in your sleep and spilling coffee on the cat. For one couple I know, once the wedding was over, there was nothing. Once they were married, they didn\\'t get along because they weren\\'t distracted by this big party. They had nothing to talk about.\\n\\nI\\'m very excited to see my friends and family, throw this fantastic party, be a bride (my dress is amazing), but I\\'m most excited to marry the man I love. I\\'m looking most forward to our life together and growing old together, not the wedding.\\n\\nFight fairly.\\n\\nYou will fight. It\\'s inevitable.\\xa0\\n\\nDon\\'t bring up the past. Last week\\'s fight was last week. If he cheated on you 5 years ago and you forgave him, it\\'s off limits. If she broke your favorite mug last month, let it go.Don\\'t ever use the words \"you, always or never.\" Ever. For example, \" You ALWAYS leave dishes in the sink and NEVER help out with the dog.\" Never? Not once? Really? And being accusatory, using \"you\" is an attack. Instead, try, \"I get really frustrated when dirty dishes are still in the sink and the dog hasn\\'t been fed. It would really make me more relaxed and happier if I got some help with those two things.\"Don\\'t talk, listen. It\\'s so frustrating when you\\'re talking and you know the other person is just planning his retort in his head. How can you respond if you don\\'t listen?\\n\\n\\nYou will never change or fix anyone. Ever.\\n\\nIf there is a behavior which needs to be changed, it must be changed by the person displaying the\\xa0 behavior. No amount of nagging, pleading or threatening will make someone change.\\n\\nIt is not your responsibility to change anyone but yourself. Learn to deal with this behavior or get over it. Or don\\'t get married. Or get divorced.\\n\\nShe will only change when she is willing to recognize and fix it herself.\\n\\nYou are two separate people and are not expected or required to think, act or behave the same way.\\n\\nBe your own person. Keep your own hobbies, interests and friends. Your partner should support and encourage this, if he doesn\\'t, you\\'ll soon be resentful, angry and unhappy. This goes both ways. Let him go to his friend Pookie\\'s man cave to watch the game. Use the time to do something you want to do. He should reciprocate so you have time to kick Jill\\'s butt at tennis or read the latest issue of Wonder Woman at a Starbucks like a grownup.\\n\\nChildren will change everything no matter how much you promise each other they won\\'t.\\n\\nWhen a couple becomes three, life will change. You can\\'t have a tiny, stinky, loud, crying, hungry, fussy human being who will never let you sleep again living in your house and nothing changes.\\n\\nYou will argue about who has baby duty and why you haven\\'t gotten to shower for three days. Your wife will be emotional, scared and may be an on-call milk service for a while. Your husband will be confused, scared, nervous, stressed and may start wearing sweatpants and old flip flops to the store.\\n\\nThis is all normal. Life will change, but, eventually, you\\'ll figure out what works for you and how to sneak in romance again.\\n\\nYou have to find your new normal as parents, not just a married couple.\\n\\nYou may not be out partying in the hottest clubs in designer clothes anymore, but you\\'ll be so excited the baby just smiled and said, \"greebo,\" that you\\'ll be content to have a new kind of party involving ordering Chinese for the nth time, watching reruns of The Walking Dead and getting four solid hours of sleep.\\n\\nIf you\\'re fighting constantly about something specific, solve the problem.\\n\\nFor example, if you argue about cleaning the house, look at your finances and figure out how to have a maid service come once or twice a month.\\n\\nIf you argue about money, set up a budget or get an accountant. Restricting one partner from ever spending money reasonably or controlling the finances is not good for a marriage.\\n\\nIf you fight about not having time to yourself because of your children, schedule a regular time with your partner when he can watch the kids for a few hours and you can go to the gym. Be sure to give the other partner the same opportunity.\\n\\nIf it\\'s still an issue, hire a babysitter or get help from a friend.\\n\\nSchedule romance and sex.\\n\\nThis sounds unromantic, but, sometimes, we get so busy and stressed we forget how hot we are for each other.\\n\\nMaking Friday night a date night or planning to go for a walk and holding hands reconnects you. It\\'s nice to feel special and attracted to your partner who you\\'ve only passed in the hall on the way to clean up the kids vomit or looking for clean socks.\\n\\nA couple may be working, parenting and the social calendar may be full, but, taking time for your marriage and physical affection is important. It takes work.\\n\\nSome things should not be shared.\\n\\nI love my fiancé and he loves me, but I don\\'t want him to show me how much ear wax he just cleaned out and I won\\'t show him how I can pop a zit with one hand.\\n\\nHe closes the bathroom door. We all know what\\'s going on, but I don\\'t\\xa0 need to see it or smell it. I don\\'t pluck my eyebrows in front of him. I\\'m not ashamed or embarrassed, but it\\'s nice that my eyebrows are always groomed (magically.)\\n\\nThis isn\\'t about shame or pretending we\\'re perfect or hiding things from each other. It\\'s about keeping the mystery going.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t need to see me change a tampon and I don\\'t want to see his belly button lint. Again, if we\\'re sick or hurt or needed help with any of this stuff, that\\'s different. I\\'d wipe my fiance\\'s butt in a heartbeat if he needed me to. In the meantime, I\\'ll scrub dead skin off my feet in private, thank you.\\xa0\\n\\nBeing married means accepting all of someone, their flaws and ugliness, not just the good parts.\\n\\nFinding the person who brings out your best and stands beside you at your worst is key.\\n\\n'}\n",

Love is a choice.\\n\\nNo marriage will fail if both people are committed to loving each other.  A marriage fails when one person or both decides it\\'s not worth trying.  A marriage fails when someone decides they are more important than their partner.\\n\\n\\n\\nWords of wisdom from my grandpa.'}\n",

Anyway, I got him a meal on his break and pretty spontaneously asked him how he knew he was marrying the right person when he picked his wife. He looked at me funny because we were not really besties or anything, but then he took my question seriously. He said that before he dated her, he was with another girl and he was absolutely crazy about her, and he asked his father the same question. His father told him, it's great to be in love and crazy about a girl, but marriage is about family and you have to marry the person you want to be the mother of your children. So he broke it off with the girl because she was not at all the person he wanted to have a family with. He said, if you're going to have children, you have to think about that before anything else because you will absolutely regret it if you don't. He was so right. I eventually broke it off with the guy I was with and I never have regretted it for a minute. I love my husband and we've been through a lot.

She attempted to go through my browser history, behind my back.\\n\\nI explained the problem, and even went into one of my bookmarks and then back to the browser history to show that it wasn\\'t recording it at all. I was immediately accused of finding a way to disable it at an earlier date. Red flag no.2. She assumes that I had something to hide, and went to lengths to hide it before she even thought to look for it.\\n\\nI denied everything she threw at me, with logical responses wherever I could, which would disprove her accusations, but it never stopped. By the end of the night, both of our voices were hoarse, all reason was lost, and we were both ready to kill each other. The only thing that stopped us from fighting was fatigue.\\n\\n730 nights of fighting until we drop later, that relationship ended. Every day I\\'d hoped that it would all change. That she would realize I wasn\\'t hiding anything, and that I wasn\\'t lying to her face. Why else would she stick around so long, if *I* was the one hiding things from her? Alas, every night, she found something to take out of context so that she could accuse me of doing Bad Thing No.8397462™. Even long after I reinstalled Chrome and got my browser history fixed, it didn\\'t matter.\\n\\nAnd I knew she kept checking my laptop while I was out of the room. I\\'d always take note of where my cursor was before I left, and it\\'d always be somewhere else when I came back. Her lack of trust in me caused me to lack trust in her, so, before long, it had just gotten worse between us. Not to mention all the shit you hear about \"If they accuse you of X, but you know you would never do X, they are probably doing X\" was sending my own paranoia through the roof.\\n\\nThough I lack solid evidence, many cues throughout our relationship, and the amount of time it took her to \"move on\" after she was \"completely destroyed\" by us breaking up makes me firmly believe that she had been cheating on me. But, assuming that it wasn\\'t the case, to this day, I have no idea what I said or did that made her ever think I would be hiding something from her, or if it was just paranoia on her part. The trust never comes back, even if you *never* gave them a reason to not trust you. Don\\'t fool yourself into thinking a breach in trust can just go away over time, like a scab or bruise, and one day find yourself four years into a relationship that has been nothing but hell for you for two years. Even if you were the one whose trust was breached, just end it. Save yourselves the trouble, the hell, and the heartbreak.\\n\\nGrowing up, I\\'d always heard that trust is what a relationship is built on. That the whole thing can\\'t thrive without it, and that, once the foundation is removed, the structure has already fallen, and it\\'s too late, and futile to even attempt to put it back. Throughout my relationship, I didn\\'t want to believe that. Who would have thought that one of the most common pieces of relationship advice is good advice? Love blinded me, and it lead to two years of hell. Don\\'t let that become you. I\\'m just lucky it ended after two years, and not the rest of my life, which it very well could have, under certain, very slightly different circumstances.'}\n",

We were young, successful professionals that had been \"approved\" for a pretty high home loan amount for our area and could have bought a much larger, more expensive home than we ended up buying. My aunt suggested that we buy what we needed (which was still a new, 3 bedroom home) rather than the most expensive home available. We planned on foregoing parenthood so we didn\\'t need a giant house for two people.  And it would give us extra money to invest and travel without a potential financial burden. Our realtor was almost angry that we weren\\'t buying at the top end of our pre-approved  home loan scale and our friends were unimpressed since they were buying much larger homes.  Then the housing market bubble burst, the economy began to struggle, people started getting laid off, and friends started losing homes and getting divorced. We endured well enough through that nonsense but then my wife fell seriously ill, and ended up unable to work.  As tough as life has been, we\\'ve never had to argue or deal with the tension of struggling to make the mortgage payment. We\\'ve had to adjust our lives to fit our new financial situation but cutting out several vacations and shopping sprees per year is much easier than selling a home and downsizing in a crap housing market while one of us is sick and homebound.  I have no doubt that living at or even slightly below our means has made our relationship easier to endure the other challenges of life.  Be smart financially and avoid having that strain if you can help it.  Life is difficult enough without having to watch every penny that comes and goes. And FWIW we also signed prenups.  That way if we do have a big fight over something, neither of us starts thinking about taking the house or savings from the other as payback. Not that we have much to take, but making smart decisions during the good times is better than making any decisions during the tough times.  Not the most romantic advice but marriage is a business partnership as much as a romantic relationship.'}\n",

That sexual desire for others does not have to take away from a strong, loving relationship. A person can observe and appreciate another person without it negatively affecting their feelings for their spouse. I also believe expecting someone to be sexually exclusive the rest of their life is unrealistic and not conducive to a sexually healthy relationship, but that\\'s my personal soap box.\\nMy husband and I are in an open relationship. We have sex with other people, often independent of the other. It was an evolved lifestyle that started with me deciding that him sleeping with someone else would not be a deal breaker for me. It was a long process of growing as partners and understanding our and each others sexual desires that could encompass multiple pages of text, but long story short, we managed to separate love from lust and realized that he could be balls deep inside someone and still want to come home and spend the rest of his life with his amazing wife (because him wanting to fuck someone else did not make me any less amazing to him). Then once we started actually experimenting with others and were able to apply logic to real life, we discovered that having sex with other people was pretty awesome. It allowed us to experience that \"new and exciting\" feeling, while appreciating the comfortable loving sex we had together. It allowed us to shift our sexual preferences that each other were unable to accommodate  (I love having sex with girls) or just not that into (his preference for anal and blow jobs, of which I\\'m less than enthusiastic) onto to other willing and able sexual partners. One of my favorite memories was a night I was tired and worn out from work and trying to make dinner and my husband was being persistently frisky. Thankfully, a close sex friend was over and I not-so-subtly asked her to take care of him so I could finish dinner and have some alone time. All of us ended up having a good night as a result. \\nI fully advocate that different couples have different needs and should not do things that make them uncomfortable. However, I feel like this particular issue is deeply rooted in the social misconception that love=sex. Society has dictated to us that if your spouse truly loves you, they wouldn\\'t possibly ever want to have a sexual encounter with anyone other than you. And I feel that this sets couples up to fail who have otherwise strong relationships.\\nAnd I don\\'t mean that couples have to have sex outside of their relationship to prosper, but taking the time to release that stigma that it\\'s inherently bad can make a big difference in how you handle sex related issues down the road. It\\'s not automatic or easy, but definitely a thought process that can be altered if you take the time to work on it. '}\n",

I\\'m more of a person to call her up and ask her what we need to talk about, and the new rule based on the second piece mentioned is that whenever one of us feels we need to either talk on the phone or put a pin in it until later to talk face-to-face, then we let it simmer for the meantime.

In my relationships I\\'ve found that OVER communicating (ie: telling someone something they already know) is much less grievous than just assuming that the other person just knows what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\nCommunication between two people is the same as playing catch with a ball. Just because the other person doesn\\'t understand what\\'s been said by you, does\\'t mean they\\'re bad at \"catching the ball,\" if you will. It could absolutely be that you suck ass at throwing the ball, and it was your fault the ball didn\\'t get to them. \\n\\nFor a real life example, my fiancée and I go to the gym most days a week. I\\'ve been lifting weights much longer than she has, and as such, I know things she doesn\\'t. This is especially true when it comes to proper form. Form is important because if you don\\'t do it correctly, you can hurt yourself. Obviously, I don\\'t want her to get injured, so I\\'ll say something when I see something. \\n\\nSo, I\\'ve opted to communicate with her. Cool beans. But here is the thing: the way things are phrased can have a HUGE impact on how the other person interpenetrates the message. \\n\\nThink of a Line Drive to the face vs a soft underhanded pitch to the chest. Both will get to the other person, one is just much harder to catch than the other. \\n\\nWe were doing tricep pushdowns and one of the main things is that you want to keep your elbows next to your side and still as much as you can. This helps isolate the movement to your triceps, bla, bla, bla. \\n\\nWell, she wasn\\'t doing it \"properly.\" \\n\\nSo, I said something along the lines of: \"Hey, try to keep your elbows in, they\\'re flaring out.\" \\n\\nWhat she heard: \"Hey, keep your elbows in because you\\'re fucking up.\" \\n\\nNow, who dropped the ball here? Long story short is that I could have phrased it better. Maybe something along the lines of \"I don\\'t want you to get hurt, try to keep your elbows in. I know it can be hard.\" \\n\\nPut yourself in her shoes for a second, something I also find helpful in a multitude of situations. Would you rather be told that \"You\\'re messing up\", or that \"I\\'m concerned for you, and I believe it\\'s in your best interest to do this correctly\"?\\n\\nI suppose this is a long winded way of saying that just because they didn\\'t get the message, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s their fault. If you explain something poorly (even if you don\\'t realize it) and the other person doesn\\'t get it, there is a chance that it\\'s your fault. \\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to apologize for your mistakes, and even sometimes for theirs. Pick your battles, some things aren\\'t worth fighting over. If needed, agree to disagree. \\n\\nEdit: removed link because it wasn\\'t working'}\n",

Just uncontrollable sobbing that started for no real reason.\\n\\nWe were in the middle of the main path where about 90% of all the dinner traffic was, at peak dinner time, where there were hundreds of people walking right past us. There was desire in me to force her to keep asking away from everyone else to not embarrass myself or her while she was crying, but I decided that she just needed to stop, sit down on the curb, and just cry. I wanted to ask why, to help solve the problem, and to fix it, because that's what I'm wired to do as an engineer. But her needs were more important than mine at the time, so all I did was let her sit down right on the curb, in front of everyone else, and just cry. For 6 minutes all I did was hold her and let her do the rest. We still look back to that day and we both agree that I did the right thing. Sometimes you just need to stop whatever you're doing and meet your partner's immediate needs, and nothing else. Simply being there with your full attention is often enough.

These may be critical issues, and ones we might *want* to solve, but are unaware of the to even begin fixing. We may have the tools to solve for the things we know, and methods of obtaining the tools for things we know we can\\'t solve immediately. Yeah, you can blame the willful ignorant, but is it fair to blame those who are unwillingly ignorant; those who would seek to understand if they only knew they lacked the knowledge?\\n\\nAnother way to think about it: Therapy and tier 1 help desk exist both for the people who don\\'t care enough, and those who simply were never had the skills or tools to solve the problem.\\n\\nIn software development, there\\'s this technique called \"rubber duck debugging\" where you talk to an inanimate object to debug an issue. You go over your code line by line and explain to the object describing what your code is *supposed* to do, and often, you\\'ll discover what went wrong. The way it works is that by going over the *whole* problem, step by step, in the most basic way *as though you try to explain to another person*, you are giving yourself a different way to think about the problem.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a technique called pair programming, with a coder and navigator, with the two programmers switching roles frequently. By having a navigator while programming, you have the outside perspective while writing the code to catch your errors, while swapping allows you to see the work from a different perspective.\\n\\nBoth these techniques have their equivalents in other areas in life. But not everybody knows about them (hell, many programmers don\\'t either). It\\'s nobody\\'s fault that these tools aren\\'t common knowledge, and you shouldn\\'t fault them for not knowing. So while it may be frustrating, as somebody who *can* find ways to solve their problems, it might help to be a little sympathetic to those who lack those tools, as you may not know whether it\\'s their fault or not.'}\n",

Because \"someone else\" is likely to be someone she loves, and why would she leave them extra work to do? This really struck a chord with me because one of the commonly touted lessons of adulthood is that nobody else is going to clean up after you.

He was thinking of it in terms of something like pointing out the sky is blue to me everyday, I know that, I can see it and I am not stupid soo pointing it out to me would be insulting.\\n\\nWhen I explained to him that yes rationally and logically I know I am attractive, I am smart, he loves me, etc. I KNOW those things but when I am having a bad day or just a regular day hearing him say \"i love you\" or \"X made me think of you because of Y\" it makes everything a bit better and feel like the sun is shining just a bit brighter. \\n\\nSo now he gets WHY i need to hear it soo he\\'s improved on his own quite a bit however it still isnt natural to him. So when I leave him i often say \"remember to text me about how beautiful I am and how much you love me\" though sometimes i will be overly dramatic and said \"remember to text me later about how you can\\'t breathe without me\" because it\\'s funny. He usually says \"i\\'ll try\" and then later texts me some other nice thing instead of exactly what I said.\\n\\nThat way he gets the reminder and I still get positive feedback from him without having to beg for it.\\n\\nThe kisses and hugs stuff he\\'s gotten way better at on his own, i made it a rule that we never leave each other without kissing and hugging even if we are angry (because you never know if it could be your last). So it\\'s automatic for him to kiss me and hug me when leaves and greets me. But i also will just say when I need a hug or a kiss.'}\n",

When you\\'re in the midst of a \"butterflies in your stomach\" burst of crazy feelings-love, loving gestures are easy and natural; you buy the person little gifts that made you think of them (because everything makes you think of them!) You write them love letters, because you *want* to make them happy and show how much you care. All the cheesy bullshit that comes naturally when you\\'re in love. But sometimes you don\\'t have those feelings, and instead you have to deliberately choose to act in a loving manner. The feelings will eventually come back, but in the meantime, you have to maintain the relationship. \\n\\nI\\'ve been with my partner 8 years, and there are occasions where I feel totally disconnected from him and times where we\\'re on top of the world and everything feels perfect. When things aren\\'t so good, though, I\\'ve learned to try more consciously to act out my decision-love. I buy him beer I know he\\'ll like and put it in the fridge, or I make sure his laundry makes it to the dryer when he falls asleep. I make food he likes after he\\'s had a hard day, or I scratch his back even when I\\'m fucking tired and just wanna go to sleep. I do those things when I\\'m head over heels in love with him too, but it\\'s easy then. To me, that\\'s what the real *work* of long-term commitment is- choosing to act in a loving manner at each junction, even in the absence of intrinsic motivation to do so. '}\n",

It is about where their bar is set in terms of the point at which they will do something.\\n\\nFor instance with laundry, if someone else isn't doing their laundry, **eventually** the person will have clothes that are dirty enough / smelly enough to trigger them into action. And unless mentally challenged, anyone can learn to do laundry if they don't already know.\\n\\nThe problem arises when two people in a relationship have drastically different standards on when things should get done. Laundry doesn't have to be an issue so long as separate hampers are kept, but if standards are misaligned for something like kitchen cleanliness then it can add strain to the relationship. Being flexible upwards AND downwards with your standards is an important part of a working relationship. If you insist that a partner matches your high/low standards then you aren't compromising, you are dictating. A lot of people might think the one with higher standards should be the one to set the bar, but that's simply not fair to the other person. There are a lot of good reasons to leave things dirty for longer just as there might be for keeping them cleaner. For example it can be more efficient to do one large load of dishes than multiple small ones. Or schedules might make it difficult for one person to do chores with the same frequency as another.\\n\\nTo go back to the example of roommates, sometimes the best solution for couples is the same as for roommates - separate all individual tasks that can be (eg. individual laundry hampers), and make sure the maintenance of common items/areas is agreed upon via active compromise.\"}\n",

But my God, it\\'s not just a philosophy. \\n\\nThe morning after arguing with my mom, and going to sleep angry (because I was \"too angry for (my) usual philosophical perspective\" and \"too tired to care\" - we\\'ve all been there)....I woke up wishing I resolved it. I never usually went to bed angry before (like I said, I\\'m an odd, over-thinking and philosophical type - an Aspie at that), but the morning after, I realized there\\'s actually a psychological effect. \\n\\nI was angrier, and it felt more \"deep seated\"(?) in a way. Like, more unresolvable. That incident of course, made me draw my own conclusions - that, during sleep, the brain pretty much uses your sub-/un-conscious mind to deal with stress - hence, \"dreaming\". After you go to sleep, any emotions have already been poured into your subconscious mind, and are no longer a task for your conscious mind (at least not as much, if at all) to deal with. After all, your conscious mind is going to need room for the next day. \\n\\nWell, if you don\\'t resolve arguments before bed - or \"go to bed angry\" - the emotions are deeper seated and it gives way for resentment to grow. The issue becomes harder to resolve, the emotion does too. \\n\\nIt can also give way for unpleasant dreams, a restless, irritable nights sleep - and so on. Everything is more complicated when you don\\'t go to bed in the right state of mind (if you somehow manage to rest). It\\'s also not beneficial for your physical health to have deep rooted emotional stress. \\n\\nNow, am I saying it\\'s gonna tear you apart if you go to bed angry once? Of course not - just know there\\'s a better chance of resolving things for a better nights sleep and lower chance of resentment in the long run if you resolve issues before bed. Also, it\\'s nice to wake up feeling bright and rested. But yeah that\\'s my take - I haven\\'t done much research but I like to think and problem solve. \\n\\n**TL;DR** - \"going to bed angry\" is more than just philosophical, and effects many aspects of health (as most may already know) and ability to resolve conflicts/any possible resentment. Sorry for going on a tangent too.'}\n",

She pretty much raised my mom to assume everything was Mom\\'s fault and I think she kinda expected me to step into Mom\\'s shoes as the family whipping boy. (whipping girl?)\\n\\nMom\\'s biggest \"crime\" was that she did leave my dad for my stepdad. But their split had been forming since before I was born and their marriage only lasted as long as it did because they both were from abusive homes and terrified of screwing up their precious child (me, Mom was told she was infertile, Dad never wanted kids. By the time I was born they both were telling family I was their miracle because I didn\\'t die in utero and Dad wasn\\'t afraid to hold or love me.) with the \\'horrors\\' of divorce. \\n\\nMy parents both married people who love(d) me, even if my stepmom and I took a few years to really mesh. They went to great lengths to be sure they did what was best for me.\\n\\nMy grandmother on the other hand HATED her husbands paying too much attention to her kids (any attention Grandma didn\\'t get for herself was wasted attention) and divorced her first three husbands because they \"didn\\'t really love her\" (which translates to they actually spent money on their step/children\\'s needs instead of letting her spend it all on herself) and her last husband was \"The love of her life\" and also molested and raped my mom and aunt, as well as giving my uncle brain damage from hitting him so often as a toddler. But that was okay, because he made good money and let her spend it and besides, her daughters were sluts anyway and just trying to take her man. (Mom was 7 the first time a family member overheard this)\\n\\nMy mom may not have been perfect, she made mistakes (although she and Dad agreed that their marriage hadn\\'t been a mistake, apparently their misery was worth it because it led to them having me, and then meeting their next spouses) and she probably shouldn\\'t have let my grandmother and stepgrandfather anywhere near me. \\n\\nBut at least she never assumed I was trying to steal her man in second grade. (And my dad and stepdad decided one day to \"have a little talk\" with the molester-husband about how many states his body would be found in if they even suspected he had touched me. I\\'m not 100% sure they were exagerating, they both had some scary friends.)\\n\\nI\\'m sorry about your ex, she sounds like she was a major PITA. Are your kids at least worth putting up with her shit? (My stepmother was married 5 times, and says the husband just before my dad was \"only worth the son he gave me\". Having met him, she\\'s actually right.)'}\n",

That's a lot in my books--and my husband's, too. I asked him how much he thought it cost to keep this level of grooming up each month, and he genuinely believed it was something like £50. When I told him the actual amount, and explained that I would be perfectly content without, even if it's just for a few months, he was more than happy to go halves with me on the cost. It's a joint expense, even if it's just on my body. \\n\\nMy hair and nails I consider my own expense, one that I wouldn't expect him to contribute to, unless it was a gift or a favour. However, I also wouldn't expect him to have a say about how I spend money from my own pot, unless of course we are talking extravagant purchases that, say, would put me (and by extension him) into a precarious financial situation.\\n\\nI really enjoy joint finances, and as my husband and I are relative new into our lives together, we're still figuring out how big a chunk of money 'our' money suddenly takes from each one's personal pot.

We get frustrated with each other at work (show me a restaurant where the front and back of house aren't frustrated with each other half the time, and I'll show you a pack of liars) but I get frustrated with him as a cook, not as my husband. As someone else said in this thread, it has to be us vs. the problem, not me vs him, and we work hard to keep it that way. It helps that we're both solution-oriented, so when one of us is wallowing in negativity the other isn't prone to indulge it but instead looks for actions that can be taken.\\n\\nNeither of us are the sort of folks who are comfortable sitting back while others are working, which has been essential. \\n\\nWe're also complementary in our skill sets - he's an amazing chef, driven and with one of the best strategic minds I've ever encountered. I'm slower, administrative/service skill set, more detail-oriented, and always poking around for failure points and weaknesses. He's great at large-scale finances, but I'm better at staying on top of daily bookkeeping. I'm a conciliator, a peacemaker who will put myself out too far just to avoid conflict, he's more assertive and willing to put his foot down on the nonnegotiables. He's a good communicator in writing, clear and concise where I tend towards verbosity (see: wall of text) but he can't spell or punctuate for shit and I'm a pretty fine editor. It all hangs together.\\n\\nWe also game together, train our dogs together, hike together. The first couple years, we let the restaurant eat our lives whole and we're still working through the burnout from that. It's very important to maintain other interests and activities, especially as a business owner who lives with their business partner!

You'll always be tempted towards other people but don't think those temptations are anything to worry about. Just worry about letting them become anything other than they truly are, the desire for novelty. We always want something new, but a happy marriage makes it pretty easy to just let those crushes go.

Having heard from my friends, I haven\\'t missed out on anything by avoiding having a string of shitty encounters instead of being with someone who is perfect for me (note that I did NOT say that he himself was perfect). I remember the butterflies and electricity you feel with a new relationship, where every comment is loaded and there\\'s that buzz you feel every time you think about them, and thus far I\\'ve never regretted being in the phase I am now, where there\\'s still attraction and passion, but also comfort and the support you get from someone you\\'ve known and been with for years. It\\'s not better or worse now, it\\'s just different. And when I think about whether I\\'d trade what I have now for those beginning-of-relationship feelings, the answer has always been consistently \"no\". \\n\\nI\\'ve never felt bored. If I\\'m bored it\\'s because we\\'re stuck in a routine, and getting in-bored is as easy as breaking the routine. I never feel trapped; that comes from being able to live my own life apart from our relationship, and being able to be \"me\" instead of always being \"us\", even with mutual friends. This relationship is the only one I\\'ve known for my whole adult life, and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m missing anything because he and I have grown through it together, and continue to do so. I think so long as you can keep your sense of self and stay true to that, and respect her while she does the same, you\\'ll be able to go fairly far. And, if the time comes when you know the relationship is no longer working for you because you\\'ve changed as people, maybe it\\'ll be time to split up. But if you\\'re happy now I wouldn\\'t worry about something that might never happen. '}\n",

By the time we\\'re married, we\\'ll have been together 3.5 years. I had this same question when I was younger. I\\'m not qualified to give advice, but I have lived what you\\'re asking about. Also, obligatory: first post.\\n\\nFirst piece of advice: don\\'t get engaged unless you\\'ve been dating 2 years. I had gotten bored of everyone (before I started dating my now-fiance) at about the 1.5 yr-or-less point. You can cycle through any pattern of (normal, non-abusive) behavior in a relationship in about 18 months. Got a problem with your partner that they promised to fix? You can see if they reverted back to type. Feeling randomly dissatisfied again with your relationship again? What has changed (or not) since the last time you felt this way? You can also weather huge life events, like we did, and see if it changes your relationship. Loss of a job, cancer scare, hellish job and hellish commute, a big promotion, financially dependent family members, and more! \\n\\nYou can certainly talk about the possibility of getting married, what type of married relationship you want, and what matters to you before that 2-year point. But give yourself enough time to \"get bored\" and see how you respond in that state of \"boredom.\" Aziz Ansari does a funny bit about this where he compares marriage to sweaters--after 2 years of wearing his favorite sweater, it\\'s totally possible he realizes one day it\\'s hideous and throws it out. Why would you get married in less time than it takes you to evaluate a sweater? (Joking, of course, but this rang true for me.) It\\'s not foolproof: I know a couple who broke up after 5 years never having had a serious conversation about their future, or even any serious disagreements. That is how I found out that \"the puppy love stage\" can last for a really long time, so just \"giving the relationship some time\" isn\\'t the right approach. \\n\\nSecond piece of advice: Live in each moment of your relationship, and don\\'t worry too much about getting bored someday. If you are really living in each moment of your relationship, engaging with that person, listening to them (even if they want to share a story you\\'ve heard three times already), and reciprocating when they do these things, and you\\'re happy when you are \"all in\" even as you figure out what\\'s for dinner, then you probably won\\'t get bored \"someday\" because you find something engaging in the everyday minutiae. There may be times I\\'m bored, but I\\'m not bored with my partner. It\\'s not my partner who\\'s boring me, and I\\'ve paid enough attention to them that I can say that with confidence. You won\\'t always feel butterflies, and things may not always feel so \"easy\", but if after 2 years you are still truly engaged and interacting with your partner and it makes you happy, it\\'s a good sign.\\n\\nThird piece of advice: Know that your feelings will change, and the rate at which you love will change. I mentioned that I don\\'t always feel butterflies, and this at first really troubled me. I felt \"drunk in love\" and \"butterflies\" for so much longer with my partner than I had ever before. When that love changed, I got really nervous. Analyzing my own feelings, my psyche,  myself, and my partner for weeks on end in my head: was it a sign? Did something change? Maybe I don\\'t see marriage in our future now?  Does love just \"plateau\" eventually? Is this just part of love--boredom? Maybe 2 months passed with me asking these questions, not really feeling \"butterflies\" and not \"falling deeper in love\", when suddenly, in the middle of a conversation where I wasn\\'t secretly psychoanalyzing myself, my love grew deeper in a way I didn\\'t even know was possible.  It turned out that I had just experienced a step-function of sorts, where my love for my partner deepened suddenly and hugely after what I thought was a plateau.  \\n\\nPreviously with my fiance, love seemed like constant, quick acceleration in a way that was new and exciting for me--there were no speedbumps or u-turns. I thought \"here\\'s a love that can last a lifetime because it can keep growing.\" When that changed, I didn\\'t know what it meant. In that 2 month period where I thought my love had \"plateau-ed\", I really thought about ending things, because I crave constant growth and personal improvement. What I learned is that your love, like a child, will grow at different rates throughout your life. You need to date people long enough to experience these emotional changes together before committing in marriage to them, and also give yourself opportunities to keep falling in love with them. I had never experienced this with anyone other than my fiance, because there were other issues in these relationships or they weren\\'t right for me, so I had never been to this emotional place. After I experienced the step-function, I thought about what an idiot I would have been to end things after that 2 month plateau. \\n\\nWhen I experienced something similar about 6 months into our engagement, I was able to 1) focus on the real problem, and 2) be patient. About one or two months later once I had time to process things (& so did my partner) we had an amazing conversation about how we were feeling, the wedding planning, our lives, etc. and I fell even more in love with my partner than before. You guessed it: step-function! This is the new rate of love in our relationship, and it I\\'ve given myself lots of time to see if I like it. *Winks* I do.\\n\\nOh, here, let me get that barf bag for ya :D. Hope it helps! This is way too long already, so I\\'ll stop now.'}\n",

I thought on that for months, tried to stay mindful of my own anger and how I expressed it.\\n\\nA big help for me was getting away from my family and being with my gf/now wife because she wouldn't engage with that type of fighting and identified it as abusive, which it totally is and was, but I didn't have the perspective to recognize that having grown up  as I did. It's hard to pull out of those habits when you're still in the verbally abusive environment - it's like a recovering alcoholic hanging out at the bar with his drinking buddies every night. I had to get away and get a handle on myself first.\\n\\nI'm a lot better now. It's weird because I feel like I have this incredibly damaging psychological arsenal that I can still access and I choose not to because I want to be a good person and especially now that I have kids I know I need to teach them how to be angry without being hurtful. Don't engage in fights, walk away, analyze your own anger before you say anything. At first it was work to consciously choose not to hurt people, it was especially hard when I was mad or in a fight, but \\u200bI've been straight for a good decade+ now and I can't imagine living any other way. I'm actually a special ed teacher who works with kids with emotional disabilities and I help kids process this stuff every day now. I used to be angry, depressed, and wrathful and my life is inexpressibly better now.\\n\\nThe sooner you accept that you do these things that are abusive, that it doesn't matter whose fault it is, and that getting control over it is probably the most important thing in your life, the sooner you can start living better. You already know you do this so you're miles ahead of lots of people. It's all going to be OK, and you will get to the point where you will never again hurt someone else on purpose.\"}\n",
